# ADIOS

Light-weight rapid application development framework for PHP 8.

Easy to use and completely free.

## Why ADIOS?

ADIOS is a framework with a **small footprint**. With only a little coding, you can create application with complete CRUD functionality, containing complex inputs (like dates, WYSIWYG editors or autocomplete) and able to manage complex tables.

You do not need to waste time configuring the router. Simply create a file and the **routing table will update automatically**.

You do not need to import UI components for the CRUD operations. **UI/Table and UI/Form components are in-built.**

You can very easily create very complex forms, thanks to the **strong form templating engine**. Tabs, grids, inputs, dashboards, ... it's done in few lines of code.
