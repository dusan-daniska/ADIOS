# ADIOS

Web application framework for PHP.

## What is ADIOS?

A light-weight framework combining different lower-levels libraries to simply web application development:

  * `React` for client-side javascript UI
  * `TailwindCSS` for CSS styling
  * `Twig` as a HTML templating engine
  * `Eloquent ORM` as a database layer
  * `Primereact` for UI components like *tables*, *forms* and *tabs*
  * and others (e.g. `react-select` for autocomplete)

## Why ADIOS?

ADIOS is a framework with a **small footprint**. With only a little coding, you can create application with complete CRUD functionality, containing complex inputs (like dates, WYSIWYG editors or autocomplete) and able to manage complex data structures.

You do not need to waste time configuring the router. Simply create a file and the **routing table will update automatically**.

You do not need to import UI components for the CRUD operations. **UI/Table and UI/Form components are in-built.**

You can very easily create very complex forms, thanks to the **strong form templating engine**. Tabs, grids, inputs, dashboards, ... it's done in few lines of code.

And you can fully customize your application.

If you wonder how ADIOS compares to other frameworks, a comparison between ADIOS ad Laravel can be found in [adios-vs-laravel.md](./docs/Miscellaneous/adios-vs-laravel.md).
