# ADIOS

## What is ADIOS?

A light-weight framework combining different lower-levels libraries to simply web application development:

  * `React` for client-side javascript UI
  * `TailwindCSS` for CSS styling
  * `Twig` as a HTML templating engine
  * `Eloquent ORM` as a database layer
  * `Primereact` for UI components like *tables*, *forms* and *tabs*
  * and others (e.g. `react-select` for autocomplete)
