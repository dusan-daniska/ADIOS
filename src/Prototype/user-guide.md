# Prototype Builder - User Guide

1. Create your project folder (a "ROOT_DIR").
2. Create a prototype.json file in your ROOT_DIR (see prototype-sample.json).
3. Run: `php vendor/wai-blue/adios/src/CLI/build-prototype -I prototype.json -A vendor/autoload`.
4. In a browser, open install.php from your ROOT_DIR folder (the file was created by the builder).
5. Log in.
