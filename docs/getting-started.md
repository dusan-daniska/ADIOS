# Getting started

```composer create-project wai-blue/adios-app```

```./bin/build.sh```

These two simple commands create an ADIOS application for you.
When done, you will get a full-featured web-application like this:

![Login](Assets/images/login.png?raw=true "Login")
![Dashboard](Assets/images/dashboard.png?raw=true "Dashboard")

Now, you are ready to customize.
