# Getting started

```composer create-project wai-blue/adios-app```

```./bin/build.sh```

These two simple commands create an ADIOS application for you.
When done, you will get a full-featured web-application with a default admin user.

Now, you are ready to customize.

# Customize

- [Getting started](#getting-started)
  - [Folder structure](#folder-structure)
  - [Widgets](#widgets)
  - [Models](#models)
  - [Controllers](#controllers)

## Folder structure

ADIOS application's root folder looks followingly:

```
  log/                 // app's log
  upload/              // where your uploaded files are stored
  src/                 // all source code of your application
    Widgets/           // app's widgets
      Customers/       // this is a widget
        Actions/       // implementation of controllers ("actions") of the widget
        Models/        // definition of models in the widget
        Templates/     // TWIG templates for the controllers
        Main.php       // "main" class of the widget
    Assets/            // all assets used in your app
      images/
      css/
      js/
    ConfigApp.php      // default configuration of your app
```  

There are many in-built features like **routing** that respect this folder structure. This means that you do not have to routers if you do not need a very complex application. You just need to respect this folder structure.

## Widgets

Widget is a standalone piece of code inside your app. You can copy widgets from other apps or easily delete and ADIOS will take care of the rest.

Every widget implements *models*, *views* and *controllers*:

  * models are implemented in the Models/ folder
  * views are implemented in the Templates/ folder
  * controllers are implemented in Actions/ folder

It's all about this - the models, views (templates) and controllers (actions).

## Prototypes

Generating of the ADIOS apps is done by the [Prototype Builder](Prototype/user-guide.md). The prototype builder uses simple JSON files to generate the PHP code. These JSON files contain the definition of the widgets, their models and UI.

The app generated by the prototype is the starting point for your further customization and development.

We recommend you to browse through the [examples](Prototype/examples) and try another prototype JSON files simply by changing the ```--input``` argument in the ```bin/build.sh``` (or ```bin/build.bat``` file).

# Conclusion

Creating an ADIOS app is super fast and easy. By using a prototype builder and a JSON file, the app can be generated using the ```bin/build.sh``` script.
